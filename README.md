# Thyme-CS147

Hello and welcome to Thyme. You will fidn the code for each page in thyme/app/[page_name]/index.js . You can find the components we use in the assets folder. 

Currently the log and connections page are fully implimented while the home screen and settings are not yet fully interactive. We use async storage to log which medications appear in the log. Slack us for any info :)
